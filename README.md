### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **dedicated Laravel developer** with over 3+ years of experience crafting robust, scalable, and secure web applications. My journey in tech began with a strong foundation in PHP and has since evolved into building modern backend solutions using Laravel, RESTful APIs, and MySQL.

I have a deep appreciation for clean architecture and well-structured code, and I take pride in developing applications that are both user-friendly and developer-friendly. Whether it's debugging a complex issue, optimizing database queries, or designing API endpoints, I approach every challenge with curiosity and precision.

I'm also a firm believer in continuous learning—currently exploring advanced Laravel ecosystem tools, real-time features using WebSockets, and expanding my skillset into Django.

If you're working on something exciting or need a backend brain, I'm always open to collaborating!
